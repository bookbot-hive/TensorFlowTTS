This documentation web page aims to fully cover the end-to-end pipeline of using [TensorFlowTTS](https://github.com/TensorSpeech/TensorFlowTTS/) to train and deploy text-to-speech models. Since the original repository seems to be inactive, these set of tutorials will work on this [fork](https://github.com/w11wo/TensorFlowTTS/) developed by Wilson Wongso which contains new features.

## Newly Added Features

- IPA-based Acoustic models for English and Indonesian
- LightSpeech

## Guides

- [Installing TensorFlowTTS](./guides/installation)
- [Train LightSpeech & Multi-band MelGAN](./guides/lightspeech-mbmelgan/intro)
- [Convert and Infer Models on TensorFlowLite](./guides/tensorflowlite.md)
- Implementing Custom Processor
